# 🛰️ Attitude Determination & Control Subsystem (ADCS)

Welcome to the ADCS team! We’re responsible for one of the most critical parts of satellite operation: **knowing where we are pointing — and making sure we stay pointed in the right direction**. Whether it's ensuring cameras are aimed at Earth or antennas at a ground station, our work directly supports mission success.

## 🌌 What We Do

As part of the ADCS group, you’ll dive into:

- Measuring satellite orientation using inertial and environmental sensors  
- Calculating real-time attitude using sensor fusion algorithms  
- Enabling active and passive control of satellite attitude  
- Testing and calibrating sensors for high-altitude and space-like environments  

Accurate attitude determination ensures all other subsystems — from communication to imaging — perform optimally.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools You’ll Work With

We use a variety of precision sensors and modules to determine and maintain orientation:

- **Barometric & Temperature Sensors**: Measure atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature to aid in altitude estimation and thermal analysis.  
- **RTD (Resistance Temperature Detectors)**: High-accuracy temperature sensors for thermal modeling and calibration.  
- **RTD ADC Modules**: Interface analog RTD signals with digital systems for precise temperature monitoring.  
- **Thermistors (PTC & NTC)**: Compact temperature sensors used for real-time thermal protection and environment sensing.  
- **IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units)**: Combine accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers to determine orientation and motion in 3D space.  
- **External ADCs**: Extend analog-to-digital conversion capabilities for various sensor inputs.
